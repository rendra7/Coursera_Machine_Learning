for this project, i will make a model to predict rainfall using dataset form Australia's Goverment 

I will use some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:
Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

I will evaluate our models using:
Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, I will use my models to generate the report at the end.
